# hello-world
This is my first project in GitHub.
You can call me Mr. Luvz Flying, since that is what I like to be called. I love programming, video editing, videography an all. My plans next year are to learn enough programming to be doing some real stuff with programming. I am prowd to have studied a little bit of programming last year, which will help me in the future to do real stuff with programming.
